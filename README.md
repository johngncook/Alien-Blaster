# Alien Blaster

Alien Blaster is a game I developed and modified from the alien invasion game in Python Crash Course.
It is a space invaders type alien shooter that puts the player in charge of a space ship to defend against an approaching alien horde.

To begin the game just run the main_game.py file.

Enjoy!
